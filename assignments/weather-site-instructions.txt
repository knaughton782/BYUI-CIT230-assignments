The Weather Site Project
The weather site is a website project that will be used throughout the course. The goal of the project is to meet the course outcomes and objectives through sequential lesson module content. The project provides opportunities to apply the concepts presented in the lessons by planning, designing, developing, and maintaining a weather related site. This project will prepare you with a foundation upon which to complete the term project at the end of the semester. The towns used in this project are fictitious.

Project Specifications
The project specifications are given to drive the design of the site and to provide general layout considerations. The instructor will act as the client for the weather site and each related lesson will provide additional specifications and requirements for the site as we move through the concepts of the course.

    *The design is consistent throughout the website providing ease of navigation and supporting positive user experiences.
    The header contains a logo, site title, site motto, and current conditions in some views.

    *The navigation menu contains links to the main pages including Home, Preston, Soda Springs, Fish Haven, Storm Center, and Gallery.

    *The footer contains contact information and map in the upper section and copyright information, the author's name, a terms of use link, and the current date in the bottom row.

    *The home page contains a current weather story with corresponding image and information sections for all three towns.

    *The town weather pages contain weather conditions and other town information or relevant articles/content.

    *Images are used to reflect the current weather condition data on the town pages and the towns themselves.

    *The site supports responsive design techniques allowing delivery of the site and its content on all classes of devices: large-wide-screened (desktop/laptop), medium-screened (tablet), and small-screened (smartphones).

In addition to the general specifications, there are development specifications that are driven by the objectives of the course. Specific developmental specifications will be added to the project as concepts are introduced in the lessons. The following represent the general objective-based specifications.

    *Structure the site with valid, standards-based, semantic markup that is responsive.

    *Style the site with valid, standards-based presentation markup that supports responsive views.

    *Ensure the site meets user expectations and provides a positive user experience by adhering to design principles and utilizing easy-to-use user interfaces.

    *The site is free from spelling and grammatical errors.

    *The published site meets its required intent as an applied-learning, assessment interface for the course.

    *The related assignment pages and site are made available online and referenced from the student's assignment portal page on GitHub Pages.
