        site purpose: The Temple Inn & Suites is a hotel chain headquartered in Bethesda, MD that builds and manages specialized hotel
        accommodations near temple locations of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints around the world. The
        owner-operated company caters to temple workers, patrons, and their families by providing specialized services and
        accommodations that meet the needs of those patrons. The hotel accommodations and services are available to anyone
        willing to abide by the terms and policies outlined by the company. The overall goal of the web site project is to
        promote and provide information about the specialized services that this hotel chain offers to meet the needs of temple
        patrons who come to serve in the temple or who participate in events such as sealings, weddings, receptions, and youth
        trips. The website should reflect the Church culture and be designed to support a temple oriented theme as well as the
        concept of being a haven of comfort and accessibility.
